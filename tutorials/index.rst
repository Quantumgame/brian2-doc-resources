Tutorial
========

The tutorial consists of a series of `IPython notebooks`_ [#]_. If you run such
a notebook on your own computer, you can interactively change the code in the
tutorial and experiment with it -- this is the recommend way to get started
with Brian. The first link for each tutorial below leads to a non-interactive
version of the notebook; use the links under "Notebook files" to get a file that
you can run on your computer. You can also copy such a link and paste it at
http://nbviewer.ipython.org -- this will get you a nicer (but still
non-interactive) rendering then the one you see in our documentation.

For more information about how to use IPython notebooks, see the
`IPython notebook documentation`_.
